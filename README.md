# ATM-project-PYTHON- ðŸ’³

## Overview ðŸš€

This project is an ATM simulator created using Python, implementing essential features for a basic banking system. Key functionalities include screen clearing after every task, utilisation of while loops for user interaction, secure pin number verification with card retrieval after three failed attempts, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal (subject to available balance), cash deposit (restricted to multiples of 10), and card return. Additionally, ASCII art is employed for visual enhancement.
